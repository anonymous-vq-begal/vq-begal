# vq-begal

This simplified version demonstrates the core concepts of our approach, while the complete implementation with all optimizations described in the paper will be released upon publication.

## Overview

VQ-BEGAL is a novel framework that integrates Vector Quantization with Bimodal Entropy-Guided Active Learning for multi-modal medical image segmentation. The approach addresses two key challenges in the field:
1. Reducing annotation burden through effective active learning
2. Preserving modality-specific information while capturing cross-modal relationships

## Important Note

**This is a prototype implementation** that demonstrates the core concepts of our approach. The current version:
* Implements the fundamental architecture and algorithm components
* Provides a working demonstration of the key ideas
* Is functional and can be used to reproduce the general approach

However, please note that this version:
* Does not include all optimizations mentioned in the paper
* May not achieve the exact performance metrics reported in the paper
* Contains a simplified implementation of some complex components

**The complete implementation** with all optimizations, hyperparameter tuning, and additional features will be released upon publication of our paper.
